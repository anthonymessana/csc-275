Final Project Proposal:

For my final I would like to make an application similar to food delivery services such as DoorDash and UberEats.  
1. For following best practices, I would refer back to the SOLID principles we learned about in the beginning of the semester.
2. To fufill the minimum of four classes, there can be a Customer class, an Order class, an OrderHandler class, and a Restaurant class. As I go into
    implementation, im sure I will also discover a few more classes that I may need to make the code base feasible.
3. For integration testing, the Customer, Order and OrderHandler class will likely all need to interact with eachother in some meaningful way.
4. For parameterized testing, if an order or a customer meets certain parameters, they may qualify for a discount on their order. Here, it can be possible to 
   test ranges of values, as well as boundary values and edge cases.
