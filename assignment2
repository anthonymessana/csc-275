Assignment 2


Problems Identified and Changes Made:

1. The name of the Pet attribute 'n' was nondescriptive. Based off its usage
it appeared to be the pets name, so I renamed that attribute to name

2. The sit method was too specific to be in the Pet parent class, and it 
there can be many cases where inheriting the sit function makes no sense,
like with the Fish in this case.

3. The take_to_vet function used a vet var only in the scope of the method.
It makes more sense to make vet an attribute, so that this function doesn't
need to be re-defined for every Pet sub-class, and now the vetinarian can be 
easily changed in the future by changing the parent Pet class vet attribute. 


class Pet:
    def __init__(self, breed, size, environment, name, vet):
        self.breed = breed
        self.size = size
        self.environment = environment
        self.name = name
	self.vet = vet

    def eat(self):
        print(f'Pet {self.name} eats')

    def sleep(self):
        print(f'Pet {self.name} sleeps')
    
    def take_to_vet(self)"
        print(f'Take {self.name} to {self.vet})

class Fish(Pet):
    def eat(self):
        print('Fish eats')

    def sleep(self): # assume fish can sleep
        print(f'Fish {self.n} sleeps')
